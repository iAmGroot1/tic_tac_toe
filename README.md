# Tic Tac Toe 
This is my first attempt at making this popular two player game.The AI that I built in this doesnt use any algorithm as such though there is a very popular algorithm generally used to build these kind of two player games called the max min algorithm. Interestingly this very same algorithm is used in bulding the AI for games such as Chess and Go. If you want to read more about the algorithm i will leave a link down below. The AI in this game is entirely based on my very own logic.

Also this is the first project i have tried after learning python for about a week though i have a background in coding in  java. The book where i learnt python from is called **Automate The Boring Stuff With Python** link for which is given down below. 

## Instruction To Play The Game:
This game doesn't implement a GUI so dont be freaked :anguished: when you see something like this:

So how this works is each box you see in the grid in the above picture actually represent a number.Say you want to place your coin on the center one then you type in **5** as shown in the picture below and click enter

The grid has numbers labelled from  **(1~9)** any other input will be evaluated as invalid. After you place your coin the computer immediately plays its turn and before you know it its your turn again :smiley:.I guess that's all you need to know to play the game unless you dont know the rules which you can find it in the links below.

As I mentioned eariler this is my very first time trying to build a game in python thus any feedback would be appericiated.
